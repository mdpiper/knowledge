# VirtualBox

I've successfully been using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
on various machines.
Currently, on ***solaria***,
I have two VMs,
located in **~/virtualbox**:

**Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**

* 40 GB hard disk, fixed size
* 8192 MB RAM
* 1 CPU
* 32 MB video memory
* location:
* user: mpiper, no password

Install with full GNOME Desktop and Development Tools.

This matches the VMs used by Travis CI.

**CentOS 7**

* 40 GB hard disk, fixed size
* 8192 MB RAM
* 1 CPU
* 32 MB video memory
* location: seec-N144
* user: mpiper, no password

Install with full GNOME Desktop and Development Tools.

This matches what I run on ***siwenna***,
and also the compute nodes on ***summit***.


## Notes

* During installation, the capture/uncapture key for the mouse is
  `Left Cmd`.

# Helm

*Helm* is the package manager for Kubernetes.
Helm packages are called *charts*.

See also my notes on [kubernetes](./kubernetes.md) and [jupyterhub](./jupyterhub.md).

I installed *helm* with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install helm
```

kubernetes-helm

List available Helm repositories:
```bash
helm repo list
```

List Helm releases:
```bash
helm list
```

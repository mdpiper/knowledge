# Zsh

I'm trying to move from bash to zsh.
Here are my notes.

## Dotfiles

I have sample 
`.zshrc`,
`.zshenv`,
`.zprompts`, and
`.zprofile`
files in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mdpiper/dotfiles).


## Prompts

I had waaay too much fun with zsh prompts.

Use the `prompt` command.

I created a few custom prompts and stored them in my `.zprompts` file,
which, if present, is loaded by my `.zshrc` file.

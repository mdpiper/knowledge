# Ant

[Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
is used to build and deploy [Java](./java.md) applications.

See also my [Eclipse](./eclipse.md) notes.

## Building a project from the command line

Use `ant`:

	$ ant build
	$ ant test

# Writing a buildfile

Instructions are given [here](https://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html).

See examples of build files I've written in the
[csdms/bmi-java](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-java) and
[csdms/wmt-client](https://github.com/csdms/wmt-client)
projects.

# LaTeX

Is the best.


## Latexmk

Begone, custom Makefiles!
All I need is Latexmk.

To latex the heck out of a document and produce a PDF, just type

    $ latexmk -pdf

Latexmk will figure out what file to compile,
whether there are biblographies, etc.

To clean up intermediate and output files when finished, use

    $ latexmk -C

These two commands may be all that's needed,
but for more options, type

    $ latexmk --help

Customize Latexmk with a configuration file;
either a **latexmkrc** file in the directory
containing the document files,
or **~/.latexmkrc** for user-wide preferences.
Here's an example **latexmkrc** file
that I used in a project to clean up the extra files
generated by BibTeX and the `multibib` package:
```
# Remove intermediate files when cleaning, including those from BibTeX.
$bibtex_use = 2;
system("rm rfp.*");
```

Latexmk is included with MacTeX,
and it's available as a package on CentOS.

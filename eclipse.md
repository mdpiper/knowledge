# Eclipse

Eclipse is really nice for working with [Java](./java.md).
I prefer it over Emacs or vi.

See also my notes on using [Ant](./ant.md) and [Maven](./maven.md).

## Breakpoints

To hit a breakpoint, you need to execute a program from the _Debug_ menu,
not from the standard _Run_ menu.

## Hidden files

Eclipse doesn't show dot files by default in the _Package Explorer_.
Turn them on under "v" (down arrow, or view, menu) > Filters.

## The most wonderful menu item

Use *Project > Clean...* to fix everything that's wrong with a project.

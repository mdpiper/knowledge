# README

This is my collected wisdom on the computing tools that I use.

Note that these notes are under version control (`svn`). 
Check out this project from my Dropbox repository with:

	$ # (Mac OS X path)
    $ svn checkout file:///Users/mpiper/Dropbox/repository/knowledge

and don't forget to commit changes.

Export a version of this project to **~/Dropbox/repository/knowledge**:

	$ # (Linux path)
	$ svn export $DROPBOXREPO/knowledge ~/Dropbox/knowledge

However, don't use this location as a working directory because `svn`
gets cranky about the repository name across Linux and Mac OS X.

# Research Computing

[Research Computing](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/)
maintains the [blanca](./blanca.md) conda cluster
on which CSDMS has purchased nodes.

## Help, status, and communication

The help desk is invaluable:

and
[rc-system@colorado.edu](https://groups.google.com/a/colorado.edu/forum/#!forum/rc-system).

## Documentation

RC documentation is now primarily hosted on GitHub,
with a wiki: https://github.com/ResearchComputing/Research-Computing-User-Tutorials/wiki.

### PetaLibrary

The PetaLibrary is an NSF-funded storage solution provided by RC.
Not for highly I/O-intensive work.

Change to **/work/<group_name>** or **/archive/<group_name>**.

RC wants a yearly report of PetaLibrary usage.

Use the following language to acknowledge the PetaLibrary
in any published or presented work:

> Storage Resources were provided by NSF-MRI Grant ACI-1126839, MRI: Acquisiton of a Scalable Petascale Storage Infrastructure for Data-Collections and Data-Intensive Discovery.

### PetaLibrary

The PetaLibrary is an NSF-funded storage solution provided by RC.
Not for highly I/O-intensive work.

Change to **/work/<group_name>** or **/archive/<group_name>**.

RC wants a yearly report of PetaLibrary usage.

Use the following language to acknowledge the PetaLibrary
in any published or presented work:

> Storage Resources were provided by NSF-MRI Grant ACI-1126839, MRI: Acquisiton of a Scalable Petascale Storage Infrastructure for Data-Collections and Data-Intensive Discovery.
